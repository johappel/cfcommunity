      Do we need another community for people with CF? Can’t we just use Facebook? What makes us different? We've asked ourselves these, and many other questions whilst working on CFCommunity over the last five years. 
      <br>

      <strong>So what are our goals?</strong>

                The updates stream is where you’ll find an overview of all the activity that is important to you. It shows you the latest updates from your friends (blogposts they have written, discussion topics they have started and photos they have shared). It also shows the activity from the groups you’re part of and the CF related causes you follow! It’s similar to the Facebook Newsfeed but with no advertisements and more control over what is shown in your feed.
